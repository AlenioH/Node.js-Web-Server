# The task

The task was to creat a Node.js command line program that will create a server that runs on localhost. This server returns the content of files in a directory called "public".

# Instructions 

The program starts the server when run in the command line. In order to be able to view the content of the "public" folder, the user will need to go to localhost:8080, which by default returns the content of the index.html file. If the user enters localhost:8080/00.jpg, the page returns the image stored in the folder.
